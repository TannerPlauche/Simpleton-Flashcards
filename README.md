 ## Get Started


  #### Start the server

   * `cd` in the `/backend`
   * run `npm install`
   * You will need to run a `postgres` server and create a new db called `simpletonflashcards`
   * Contact me (Tanner Plauch√©) for the DB config
   * If you do not have `nodemon` installed globally, install it by running `npm install -g nodemon`
   * Run `npm start`
   * visit `localhost:8000` for current build version

 #### Start the front end dev server

  * `cd` in the `/frontend`
  * Run `npm install`
